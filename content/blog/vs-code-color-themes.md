Choosing the right color theme for your VSCode setup can significantly improve your baseline coding experience. An enjoyable theme not only positively impacts your psychology but also enhances readability and reduces eye strain. Here are some of my current favorite VSCode color themes, split between light and dark options, with a bit more detail on what makes them stand out.

### Light Themes

When you prefer a brighter coding environment, these themes offer clean and vibrant aesthetics.

  With its pale green hues, GreenLittlefa provides a refreshing and calm backdrop for your coding experience. It stands out from the usual blue or gray light themes, giving your editor a soft, garden-like atmosphere that’s easy on the eyes yet distinctive.

  A beautifully warm and inviting theme, Horizon Bright Italic is characterized by its pale pink tones and balanced contrast. Unlike high-saturation themes, this one offers a soft yet colorful palette that feels easy on the eyes. The subtle use of *italics* adds a gentle emphasis on keywords and comments, enhancing readability without being distracting. It’s a great choice for those who want a vibrant editor that still feels airy and calm.

### Dark Themes

For those who prefer a darker interface, these themes offer a cool and immersive coding experience, often with striking accent colors.

  Prepare to satisfy your neon dreams with SynthWave '84. Inspired by the aesthetics of the Synthwave genre, this theme delivers a retro-futuristic experience with dark purples, deep blacks, and hot pink accents that echo '80s music videos and arcade culture.

  Despite its flashy palette, SynthWave '84 is surprisingly easy on the eyes—especially at night. The contrast is smooth, and the colors are vivid without being harsh. It’s also known for its optional neon glow effect, which adds a soft radiance to your code, making it feel more immersive without being overwhelming.

  Stylish, nostalgic, and practical, SynthWave '84 is a great choice for late-night sessions or anyone drawn to vaporwave visuals and retro digital vibes.

  Calamity is a purple theme with medium to high contrast, designed for developers who want clarity without sacrificing color aesthetics. It blends deep purples with well-separated syntax highlighting, making it easy to follow code structures while staying visually appealing.

  This theme is great for those who want something dark with a unique identity that isn't pure black or monochrome.
